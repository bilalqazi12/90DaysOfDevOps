DevOps is a set of practices, tools, and a cultural philosophy that automate and integrate the processes between software development and IT teams.

Automation is the addition of technology that performs tasks with reduced human assistance to processes that facilitate feedback loops between operations and development teams so that iterative updates can be deployed faster to applications in production.

Scaling in DevOps is the process of expanding and shrinking your systems and practices as you need them.

Infrastructure is a concept that revolves around the idea of managing infrastructure with the help of code. This is done with the help of certain tools or programs which can help to carry out the tasks automatically!

DevOps is important because it's a software development and operations approach that enables faster development of new products and easier maintenance of existing deployments.
