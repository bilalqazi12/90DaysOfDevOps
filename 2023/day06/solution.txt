3. Read about ACL and try out the commands `getfacl` and `setfacl`

What is ACL?
A network access control list (ACL) is made up of rules that either allow access to a computer environment or deny it. Access control lists are used for controlling permissions to a computer system or computer network. They are used to filter traffic in and out of a specific device. 

getfacl:
The getfacl command displays the access permissions of files and directories with file name, owner, group and the ACL's(Access Control List). When we create a directory it is created with a default set of access permissions and by using getfacl we will be able to see the access rights.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-2-61:~/devops$ getfacl file.txt 
# file: file.txt
# owner: tahir
# group: linux
user::rwx
group::---
other::---

setfacl:
setfacl sets (replaces), modifies, or removes the access control list (ACL) to regular files and directories. It also updates and deletes ACL entries for each file and directory that was specified by path.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-2-61:~/devops$ setfacl -m u:bilal:r file.txt 
setfacl: file.txt: Operation not permitted
ubuntu@ip-172-31-2-61:~/devops$ sudo setfacl -m u:bilal:r file.txt 
ubuntu@ip-172-31-2-61:~/devops$ getfacl file.txt 
# file: file.txt
# owner: tahir
# group: linux
user::rwx
user:bilal:r--
group::---
mask::r--
other::---
